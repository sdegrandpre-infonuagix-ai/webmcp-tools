# Collection of WebMCP tools

This repository contains a suite of developer utilities and demos designed to support the adoption of the WebMCP API.

## Developer Utilities

- [**Model Context Tool Inspector**](https://github.com/beaufortfrancois/model-context-tool-inspector): A Chrome Extension to let web developers inspect web pages to verify if WebMCP tools are correctly exposed, visualize the input schema, and debug connection issues directly within the browser.
- [**WebMCP Evals**](evals-cli/): A CLI Tool to evaluate the tool-calling capabilities of LLMs by defining test cases and schemas to verify if an interactive agent correctly calls tools based on user inputs.

## Demos

- [**Travel WebMCP Demo (Imperative)**](demos/react-flightsearch/): A React-based flight search application designed to demonstrate WebMCP integration. This project showcases how a web application can expose structured tools to an AI agent or automation layer, allowing it to programmatically interact with the UI (searching flights, applying filters, reading results) via a standardized interface.
- [**Le Petit Bistro (Declarative)**](demos/french-bistro/): A WebMCP simple implementation for a restaurant reservation system. It allows an AI agent to interact directly with a web-based booking form, validating and submitting data on behalf of the user using declarative tool definitions.
- [**WebMCP zaMaker! (Imperative)**](demos/pizza-maker/): A demo where AI agents can control size, style, toppings, and layers to build the perfect pizza using imperative tools.
